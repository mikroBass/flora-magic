# flora-magic

This is a program I have written that allows to play with :
- a Flora Adafruit board
- Adafruit NeoPixels and leds
- a LSM9DS0 IMU chip

The idea is to stich this hardware to a beatiful glove (it could be an other cloth)
and produce subtile led effets according to the movements

This is raw material to be used by future e-wearing projects

SetPix() and SetLed() are totally customizable and not really interesting at this stage
